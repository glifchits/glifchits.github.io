And I thought it was worth writing about.

My undergrad degrees have taken 5 and 2/3 years to achieve -- I entered Laurier in September 2010; fresh, na√Øve, with my eyes half-closed. I didn't cultivate many interests in my high school years, and as such I had no idea what I was going to do with my life. Business was my first choice simply because it seemed like a practical and lucrative option.

It's a little ridiculous how we're forced to decide on our lives in high school. I don't think anyone really knows what they're in for until they get here. Some kids are set on being accountants, but after their first co-op, they realize they hate it. I'm sure the opposite case exists for accounting, but personally I've never heard of it happening.

Some people discover a real passion for a totally new subject while they're in university. I would have loved to hear that "it's okay" to transfer programs and fields of study. It's something I wish were encouraged for all people, because it's a shame when someone refuses to dive deep into something they might love solely due to external pressures.

In my time at university I've had the pleasure of learning about many subjects -- some enthralling, some less so -- which have challenged me and/or taught me to think differently.
