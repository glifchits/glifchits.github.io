title: My Directed Research Project â€“ Quantum Search
layout: post
---

In the fall semester of 2015, I chose to take a directed research course as one
of my computer science electives. I was interested in quantum computing thanks
to an intro course I took in the winter of that year, so I asked Professor
[Shohini Ghose](http://legacy.wlu.ca/homepage.php?grp_id=1428), who taught that
course, to supervise my research project.

After some exploration and thinking, Dr. Ghose proposed doing research jointly
supervised by [Ilias Kotsireas](http://web.wlu.ca/science/physcomp/ikotsireas/)
into the direct application of quantum algorithms for a class of more general
problems. Professor Kotsireas introduced me to his research in combinatorial
designs, and we finally decided that my research could be about how one could
use quantum search algorithms to find D-optimal sequences.

I'm making my research report public here for anyone who is interested. I try to
give a good background in quantum computing, and introduce the minimal amount of
background needed to understand the D-optimal sequence problem. I describe how
we use [Grover's Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm), a
famous quantum algorithm, to the specific D-optimal problem.
