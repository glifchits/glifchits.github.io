I've been shockingly lucky in my career.

I entered university apathetic and disengaged, unsure of the world and what it entailed. I didn't know what to expect after school, and I'd hardly spent a thought on it. Studying business sounded good, but there wasn't much more rationale to that decision.

Today, as I'm wrapping up my university journey, I'm privileged to be employed in a job that I'm really excited about. I'm on a career path that motivates me to learn more and develop skills. Most exciting of all, I feel optimism about the future. The hard choices I have to make are about which great opportunity I should aim for.

What happened? Early on, in my first co-op term, I was so fortunate to be matched with a manager who, in a few short months, taught me so much. I was still too young to understand what was going on, and my laziness could have squandered my credibility. Thankfully, my manager didn't write me off as some below par co-op student. We've since kept in touch, and today I'm proud to call him a mentor.

He showed me what it means to be a professional in my field. In that job, I learned skills that I'd talk about in almost all my future job interviews. I discovered what I'd need to learn that would put me on a path to fostering my professional skill set even further.

He introduced me to academia, and a deeper love of knowledge. He'd send us academic papers to read for our own personal interest. Even though it was terribly out of my depth, it was a deep gesture of respect and showed me how research (especially interdisciplinary thinking) pushes the boundaries of knowledge.

He introduced me to a group of people -- other students he's mentored -- and in that alone, I've met some of the smartest and most driven peers I know. Today, they're all doing great things. Funny enough, one of them started a great company, and hired me!

He demonstrated how to find opportunities out of nothing, and how to make lemonade out of lemons. Pick a skillset, and foster it. Always strive to be great at what you do, and eventually you'll discover that your skills are valuable in many contexts.

He taught me that we should constantly be pushing ourselves to grow. He made me understand that if you're the dumbest person in the room, you're in a good room. Prepare to learn, and strive to match that level.

For me, there's an important corollary of that. If you're the smartest person in the room, there's no one who can be a mentor to you.

My mentor has truly changed my life. I think there's not much way to repay him besides gratitude, but if I ever happen to be the smartest person in the room, I'll pledge to be the best mentor I can be.
