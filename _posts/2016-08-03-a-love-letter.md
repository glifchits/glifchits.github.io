Those who know me well know that, when it comes to food, I'm a man of simple
tastes. Pasta is most delicious with smooth tomato marinara and olive oil.
Loaded fries, for me, shall not be more than fried potatoes with a generous
helping of Heinz catsup. Any pizza that deviates from the Neapolitan margherita
ideal (mozzarella and red sauce) is a form of blasphemy.

But there's another meal that captivates me. It is a remarkable dish that sends
me into a daze. When this food enters my sights, my heart races with excitement
and anticipation. It's a simple meal, consisting of two separate components each
with only one significant ingredient, but its a meal that restores me from a
wretched, starved beast, to a glowing man again, enlightened and invigorated.

This magical meal is daal chawal, served exclusively at [Aunty's
Kitchen](http://www.auntyskitchen.ca). It is lentil soup with a side of rice.

The daal (lentil soup) is a golden elixir that explodes with taste --
hot spice, garlic, cumin, and transcendent flavours whose secrets will taunt me
for as long as I live. The daal is a sublime potion; it is both highly
satisfying, with an optimal viscosity that provides heft and body; and obscenely
comforting, as a warm substance which coats the esophagus like a vacuum seal
that traps in pure delight. This daal lifts me into a state of serene ecstasy.

The rice is infused with hints of flavour arising from cumin, cloves,
peppercorn, a touch of ginger, the nuttiness of basmati, and again the
unachievable <i>je ne sais quoi</i> that makes this rice both irreplaceable and
irreplicable. The rice achieves an elegant consistency: sturdy grains which are
never so soft as to dissolve, and oh-so subtly oiled, which lets clumps of rice
stick together naturally, forming loose structures that soaks up the daal
perfectly. The rice is a multi-sensory experience: beyond its flavours and
texture, its individual grains sample from a gradient of colour ranging from
light cream to a vibrant orange.

Whenever I've finished eating a plate of Aunty's daal chawal, I'm miserable that
the experience is over. But each time I complete the meal I'm sated: my appetite
has been fully attended to. And even though the value I extract from this dish
is virtually priceless, the cost of this perfect meal is just around $6.50 CAD.

    likely explanation is that I was so stunned at the time that my skills in
    camerawork escaped me. This very photograph marks possibly the first time I
    consumed this life-changing meal. The next recorded daal occurred was 8 days
    after this was taken &mdash; after that, the next one was the day following.

I'm known amongst the virtuous apprentices who staff Aunty's Kitchen as "that
guy who gets daal all the time", and that's a badge I wear with honour. I
anticipate continuing my highly regular patronage of Aunty's for as long as I
reside in Kitchener-Waterloo, and if I ever move away, it might be the
(inanimate) thing I miss most.

But dear Aunty's Kitchen, I plead one thing of you. You and your noble staff
have outdone yourself when it comes to this daal. But I'm convinced your chefs
possess a Midas touch -- I beg you to expand your vegetarian offerings! I've
already seen what you can do with a chana masala, and my God, it is beautiful.
Why must you limit it to a Thursday special?! And yes, I know you serve shahi
paneer, but I'm trying to avoid cheese, I apologize!

Oh, what am I saying -- I could never stay mad at you, Aunty's Kitchen. For as
long as we've been together, you've never let me down (save once, when you were
**out** of daal, and I forgave you the next day). But humour me, perhaps with a
nice aloo gobi, or by resurrecting the vegetable biryani, and make this old fool
the happiest guy on earth.

Yours always,

George Lifchits
