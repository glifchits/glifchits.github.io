There's something going wrong in the way that companies are treating their workers. [The Life and Death of an Amazon Warehouse Temp](http://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/life-and-death-amazon-temp) is a chilling account of how Amazon's demands of their workers are unrealistic.

Conditions in these warehouses are gruelling. The article shows that workers frequently pass out of heat exhaustion or fatigue. According to one report, 15 people collapsed in a single day. Policies are in place to mitigate these issues, but they are failing. Physical assessments show warehouse managers where not to physically stress a particular worker, but workers avoid physicals in fear of discrimination. And the temp workers, who play a crucial role in filling seasonal peaks of demand, receive almost no insurance or benefits.

The article is centred around the trajectory of Jeff Lockhart, a man who was laid off from a steady job at a building supply store. Jeff was a hard worker who hoped to rise the ranks to a stable position in the Amazon warehouse. He earned a reputation for being a really efficient and hard worker. Tragically, his cause of death is linked to over-exertion.

Unsurprisingly, Amazon preyed on the poor. They are upfront about the physical nature of the work, issuing honest warnings in their recruiting materials. But the warehouse that Lockhart died in is located in a town of Virginia where over 25% of people live in poverty. When are desperately looking for work, unfit candidates won't self-select away; instead, they'll rationalize that they could handle it. If the work was too much for Lockhart, who was a large man with a burly frame and improving fitness, then I have a hard time imagining what a suitable worker would look like.

Relaxing the demands on these workers would be great. But the market response might be too negative. People have come to expect unreasonably quick delivery from Amazon -- indeed, several Amazon initiatives [[1](www.amazon.com/primenow), [2](www.amazon.com/primeair)] revolve around the theme of fast delivery. As a pillar of their competitive advantage, I suspect that even a slight fall in their delivery efficiency would have a disproportionately high impact on their business.

We don't need labour automation because it improves efficiency and helps our economy. We need labour automation because our economy demands it.
