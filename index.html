    I'm a recent graduate of the business and computer science double degree
    program, at Wilfrid Laurier University. I've earned degrees in business
    administration and computer science. This program allowed me to study all
    the functional areas of business in tandem with computer science. During my
    time at Laurier I took courses ranging from finance to quantum computing.

    I'm a skilled developer with substantial experience working on the full
    stack. My current expertise is in Python and Javascript with a focus on
    React.js web apps, but I enjoy challenges and applying tech to new and
    interesting problem domains. Keeping on top of developments in the tech
    world is important to me for understanding new ways of solving problems and
    new potential business opportunities. Staying well-rounded is crucial to
    me!

    I have knowledge of the business world and a firm understanding of business
    logic. School has exposed me to critical business thinking via the case
    method and a number of required courses in accounting, marketing,
    operations, finance, and strategy. Although I focus on my skills as a
    developer, I use my business acumen to guide me through decision-making
    amongst ambiguity. I aspire to one day lead a team to build a product.
