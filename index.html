    I'm a graduate of the business and computer science double degree
    program at Wilfrid Laurier University. This program allowed me to
    simultaneously study the functional areas of business as well as the
    principles of computer science. During my time at Laurier I took courses
    ranging from finance to quantum computing, travelled the world with the
    debating team, slugged back many litres of black Starbucks blonde roast,
    and engaged my peers in both educated discussions and meaningless banter.

    I'm a skilled developer with substantial experience working on the full
    stack. My current expertise is in Python and Javascript with a focus on
    React.js web apps, but I enjoy challenges and applying tech to new and
    interesting problem domains. Keeping on top of developments in the tech
    world is important to me for understanding new ways of solving problems and
    new potential business opportunities. Staying well-rounded is crucial to
    me! I also can't help but sustain a nerdy enthusiasm for academic
    developments in the field, but I admit I'm better at reading code than
    reading papers.

    I have knowledge of the business world and a firm understanding of business
    logic. School has exposed me to critical business thinking via the case
    method and a number of required courses in accounting, marketing,
    operations, finance, and strategy. Although I currently focus on my skills
    as a developer, I use my business acumen to guide me through
    decision-making amongst ambiguity. I aspire to one day lead a team to build
    a product. I will also note that I'm comfortable using language such as
    “synergy”, “ROI”, “value-creating”, and “moving the needle”.
