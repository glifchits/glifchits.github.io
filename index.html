    I'm a student at Wilfrid Laurier University in Ontario, Canada. I'm in
    the business and computer science double degree program, with a co-op
    option. This means that I hope to graduate with two degrees &mdash; a
    Bachelor of Business Administration and a Bachelor's of Science in
    Computer Science &mdash; and I'm gaining work experience along the way!

    I'm a skilled developer with substantial experience working on the
    full stack. I'm proficient in Python and am comfortable working with
    HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL, C, Java, the command line, and whatever
    else you'd like to throw at me! In my spare time I like to take free
    online courses via Coursera and build webapps to get experience
    working with some new tech skill I haven't used before.

    I have knowledge of the business world and a firm understanding of
    business logic. In school, I've completed a new venture project and
    done business cases. I have learned a ton of Excel, VBA, and
    understand decision modeling using Crystal Ball and Arena. I've also
    taken accounting classes, business law, and so forth.
