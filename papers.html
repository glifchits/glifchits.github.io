<p>
    During my stint at graduate school I had a few papers published.
    Computational social science is a pretty broad field; my work gravitated towards psychology and statistics.
    However I was fortunate to learn things within other subjects including machine learning, social networks, and complex systems.

<h3 class="papers">Success stories cause false beliefs about success</h3>
<p>
    Success stories typically focus on just a few examples to try to teach people about success.
    Unfortunately, this is just a form of cheating with statistics, because a few examples will tell you nothing about a general pattern.
</p>
<p>
    We ran an experiment with over a thousand participants and found that people were strongly influenced by these kinds of anecdotes.
    By randomly showing participants a few dropouts who became successful startup founders, we caused them to 
    bet on a dropout becoming a successful startup founder (and vice versa for graduates).
    Participants reported medium to high confidence in their bets and many justified their bets with an explanation for why a dropout (or graduate)
    might be succeed.

<h3 class="papers">Linguistic effects on news headline success</h3>
<p>
    A unique dataset gives us the results of thousands of A/B tests on headlines from a popular news website called Upworthy.
    With this data, we can investigate the linguistic properties that drive the success of text.
</p>
<p>
    This is a registered report, in which we declared our hypothesis based on a small exploratory dataset.
    Since we didn't have access to the full data, we avoid the problems of p-hacking or overfitting.
    Our hypotheses will be rigorously tested againsted the full data.

<h3 class="papers">How humans sample to learn functions</h3>
<p>
    Every day, humans learn functional relationships, be they linear, periodic, exponential, and so on.
</p>
<p>
    We ran an experiment where we asked participants to learn a function by choosing a limited number of samples.
    People generally followed a process of sampling where the uncertainty was the highest (similar to a standard Gaussian Process model)
    and those who followed this strategy more closely were better at learning non-linear functions.
