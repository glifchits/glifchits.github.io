===================

Thanks for taking a look at the repository for my personal portfolio site! My original site was a node.js Express app with a little back end to send email via a nice contact form, but it was hosted on Heroku for free and took a couple of seconds just to boot up. I decided to go for the Github pages static site approach. (The original app is in the git history).

Regardless, the site is still created using some of the node.js preprocessors that were bundled with the Express config I used. That is, the HTML is written in the Jade syntax and the CSS written with LESS syntax.
