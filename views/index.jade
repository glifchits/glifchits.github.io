          I'm a student at Wilfrid Laurier University in Ontario,
          Canada. I'm in the business and computer science double
          degree program, with a co-op option. This means that I 
          hope to graduate with two degrees, a Bachelor of Business
          Administration and a Bachelor's of Science in Computer
          Science, and I'm gaining work experience along the way!

          I'm a skilled developer with experience using a variety of
          different languages. I'm fluent in Python, HTML/CSS, and
          SQL. I also have experience with Javascript, Scala, C,
          and a variety of web frameworks in Python like Django and
          Flask. In my spare time, I'm trying to gain a deep 
          understanding of C and learning Clojure (my first Lisp!)

          That said, I've also got a knack for business. I have 
          the business sense that you might not find with pure
          developers. In school, I've completed a New Venture group
          project, business decision models projects making heavy
          use of economical logic (and Microsoft Excel), financial 
          and managerial accounting, and more!
