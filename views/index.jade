//   hi there, source peeker.  I'll warn you that the source HTML looks disgusting, because it is a jade template rendered by node.js, and they don't pretty print the HTML they render. If you want to see where my actual work went, you can view the source of this website on my Github account. :)

          I'm a student at Wilfrid Laurier University in Ontario,
          Canada. I'm in the business and computer science double
          degree program, with a co-op option. This means that I 
          hope to graduate with two degrees — a Bachelor of Business
          Administration and a Bachelor's of Science in Computer
          Science — and I'm gaining work experience along the way!

          I'm a skilled developer with experience using a variety of
          different languages. I'm fluent in Python, HTML/CSS, and
          SQL. I also have experience with Javascript, Scala, C,
          and a variety of web frameworks in Python like Django and
          Flask. In my spare time, I'm trying to gain a deep 
          understanding of C and learning Clojure.

          That said, I've also got a knack for business. I have 
          the business sense that you might not find with pure
          developers. In school, I've completed a New Venture group
          project, business decision models projects making heavy
          use of economical logic (and Microsoft Excel), financial 
          and managerial accounting, and more!
